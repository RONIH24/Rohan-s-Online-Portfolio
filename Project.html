              Project Name: Python Covid Escape Room<br>
Course: CSE(Computer Science Essentials)<br>
Duration: 3 Weeks(March 21-April 14(2021))<br>
Objective: Create a Escape Room with Python that has some sort of COVID-19 Related Theme<br>
Type of Project: Partner Project<br><br><br>

In this project, me and my partner were tasked with creating an escape room style game on the platform Repl.it, however, there was a twist. We had to somehow incorporate the theme COVID-19, into our escape room. We included this theme in our project by having the reward for the user who escapes be having Covid go away. We also made some of our questions Covid themed. In our code, we incorporated lots of different features that helped our game seem more visually appealing, as well as fun to play. One challenge we faced was incorporating loops. A special thing about this project was that we were not allowed to use for loops. We were able to overcome this challenge by creating our own style of loop. We did this through functions. If you call a function inside a function this simulates a loop. My role in our project was doing a significant part of the <a href="https://replit.com/@asdcosta75/CSE31Template#Escape_room/Dcosta_Nihalani_Final.py" style="color:black" target="_blank">coding</a> as well as in-depth <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MVmKwwu_A8Ko8kvkgsNv4YVLaFUVQnKvj9PbkyZj8EI/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:black" target="_blank">documentation</a>. Some skills that helped me during this project were both technical and computer science based. My organization and planning skills helped me create good documentation for our project, as well as good sprint planning. My python knowledge helped me incorporate more advanced features in our app providing for an overall better game such as sleep timers for suspense. For the coding, I made a lot of improvements based on peer feedback. One of the major improvements was adding a difficulty choice for the user. This improved our game a lot and allowed us to add more user input and choice. Me and my partner also made a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1El8mJcHrARwj_q-KM1yxFxF1DoTEuFZq/view?usp=sharing" style="color:black" target="_blank">video</a>, modeling the game and some of the paths you can take.

              Project Name: MIT App Inventor Game Design<br>
Course: CSE(Computer Science Essentials)<br>
Duration: 3.5 Weeks(October 19- November 13(2020))<br>
Objective: Create a Game in MIT App Inventor that has something to do with a hot topic news item<br>
Type of Project: Partner Project<br><br><br>

In this project me and my partner had to create a video game on a platform named MIT App Inventor. MIT App Inventor is an app designing software that uses block based coding. First, we started off our project as a baseball game, where the user would get the ball pitched towards them then they would hit the ball. Then, we ran into our first challenge. Our app had to be tied to a hot topic news item. This scrapped our whole idea and we had to restart from scratch. Luckily, since there were so many wildfires happening in the world, we were able to come up with an idea for a game about putting out fires. My role on this project was creating a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UIM24onJyyYifau7_sacw2wQRv207Xer/view?usp=sharing" style="color:black" target="_blank">story mode</a> for our game, as well as having good in-depth <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LacTbW7VJthhEBOhYXtrJfb6LQzBiQXC2wsxX9BCA1o/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:black" target="_blank">documentation</a>. Using some of my creativity skills, I was able to create a fun and interactive story mode, where the user is able to play as a firefighter trying to graduate firefighter school. They work theyâ€™re way through various challenges and tests, and the story mode even has multiple endings! As for the documentation, my knowledge on organization and neatness, helped us create great documentation that is not super boring to read. Some skills I felt I learned throughout the course of this project were mainly about coding. Being exposed to so much block coding not only helped me become proficient in block based programming, but also helped me understand different types of algorithms. These algorithms could be incorporated into so many other programming languages. Lastly, me and my partner made a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gDDeRaUZuv42p5Uarc9VrSmbhJZQ4jxK/view?usp=sharing" style="color:black" target="_blank">video</a> highlighting our game.
