      <h1>DEDA Academy Narrative</h1>
      <h4>	The Dublin Engineering Design Academy or DEDA is an exclusive program that helps Dublin High School students on their journey to becoming engineers. The academy features two pathways, one for computer science and one for engineering. All of the courses offered in this program are hands-on and promote learning different skills that will be extremely beneficial in a STEM major. The DEDA program includes 60 people per class that were all hand picked based on an application. Out of over 100 applicants I was selected for the computer science pathway. Some of the benefits of being in the academy include access to different courses, job and internship opportunities, exclusive engineering field trips, guest speakers, as well as a mentorship program that academy students complete in their junior year. Throughout this narrative I will talk about what I have gathered from different guest speakers, my work experience, and courses I have taken that further hone my computer science and engineering skills.<br><br>
	    In my first semester of sophomore year, I was lucky to attend two guest speakers that helped me gain knowledge about what kind of career I would be interested in. The first of those guest speakers was Gary Richter who was a security analyst for the government. Listening to him talk helped me learn about the actual excitement of some of these seemingly boring engineering jobs. He got to travel the world identifying possible threats, a job like this seemed very exciting but was not meant for me. Overall, this talk helped me realize that a job like this would be too crazy and overwhelming for me, a job a little toned down would be what I would like to pursue. The second guest speaker I was able to attend was Donald James from NASA, I was able to connect more with this and it was really something I would be interested in. The most important thing that stood out to me during the talk was how just by working at a company like NASA he was able to make an impact on so many people. Something like this is much more interesting to me and really helped me gain more knowledge about what it means to work at a place like NASA.<br><br>
	    My work experience, while currently it has not been specifically applicable to computer science or engineering, it has taught me valuable skills that I will be able to take forward with me throughout the rest of my career. I volunteered as an assistant coach on a U12 rec soccer team, this meant I would teach young children the fundamentals of soccer, as well as sportsmanship and different social skills that will help them for the rest of their lives. While coaching, I tried to always foster a positive attitude and growth mindset, it is important for children to have high self confidence and always think they can do better and be better. This experience not only earned me over 50 volunteer hours, but also gave me experience with teaching younger kids basic skills. This will help me in the future and could even be applied to computer science or engineering. <br><br>
	    Lastly, I have taken two major computer science and engineering courses. In my freshman year of high school I took Computer Science Essentials or CSE. This class helped me learn the basic concepts of programming, as well as diving further into Python and HTML/CSS which Iused to code this website. Aside from programming this course taught me different methods to go about doing projects, the most prominent I learned was doing a method called sprints. Documentation is also a key part of a programmers project and this helped me gain a base knowledge of the structure and format documentation should generally be in. The second course I am currently enrolled in is Principles of Engineering or POE for short. In the first semester we focused largely on physical building and engineering, while veering more towards coding at the end of the semester. This class has taught me necessary skills that an engineer needs in order to be successful, the most important of these is keeping an engineering notebook. This notebook must be signed and dated everyday to ensure and have proof that the work is actually done by me on the right date. <br><br>
	    Overall, these experiences have all helped me grow to what I am today. I hope to continue learning and growing in the DEDA program and look forward to the future!
